# Vehicle-Route-Optimization

This project demonstrates vehicle routing optimization using OpenRouteService (ORS) to optimize delivery routes in Yangon. The script calculates optimized routes for multiple vehicles based on a set of shop locations.

### Features

- Uses OpenRouteService (ORS) for route optimization

- Assigns delivery jobs to multiple vehicles efficiently

- Visualizes routes and stops using Folium

### Setup

1. Obtain an API key from OpenRouteService (ORS).

2. Replace api_key in the script with your ORS API key.

3. Define the shop locations in coordinate format: [longitude, latitude].

4. Set the vehicle start location appropriately.

### Output

- The script generates a map displaying the optimized routes.

- Markers indicate shop locations and vehicle start points.

- Routes are color-coded for different vehicles.
